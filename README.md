# Virtual Enviroment Python

Creating the virtual space allows us to have a controlled space where we can install libraries without affecting the entire python environment that we have on our server or personal computer.

    $ python -m venv env

How to activate our environment isolate or virtual environment, Once you enter the following line of code you will see ***(env)*** at the beginning of your workspace or terminal

How to install the Python libraries in our environment.
